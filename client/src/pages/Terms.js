				<small>
					Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease

				</small>
				<h4 className='my-4'>Limitation of Liability</h4>
				<small>
					Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability
					of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this

					provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been
					advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy
					fails of its essential purpose.
				</small>
				<small>
					Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
					limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which
					means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these
					states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent
					permitted by law.
				</small>
				<h4 className='my-4'>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h4>
				<small>
					The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all
					faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent
					permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on
					behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and
					service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether
					express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service,
					including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
					particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that
					may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or
					trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company
					provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of
					any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any
					intended results, be compatible or work with any other software,
					applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet
					any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any
					errors or defects can or will be corrected.

				<small>
					Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
					company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
					express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
					Service, or the information, content, and materials or products
					included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
					error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any

					Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf
					of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms,
					malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
				</small>
				<small>
					Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
					warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
					consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
					not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
					set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
					enforceable under applicable law.
				</small>
				<h4 className='my-4'>Governing Law</h4>
				<small>
					The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall
					govern this Terms and Your use of the Service. Your use of the
					Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or
					international laws.
				</small>
				<h4 className='my-4'>Disputes Resolution</h4>
				<small>
					If You have any concern or dispute about the Service, You agree to
					first try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us (
					Ilamurugu and Associates ).
				</small>
				<h4 className='my-4'>For European Union (EU) Users</h4>
				<small>

				<h4 className='my-4'>United States Legal Compliance</h4>

					that is subject to the United States government embargo, or that has

				</small>
				<h4 className='my-4'>Severability and Waiver</h4>
				<h5 className='mt-4'>Severability</h5>
				<small>
					If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or
					invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish
					the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
					applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full
					force and effect.
				</small>
				<h5 className='mt-4'>Waiver</h5>
				<small>
					Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to
					require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not
					effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such
					performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach
					constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
				</small>
				<h4 className='my-4'>Translation Interpretation</h4>
				<small>
					These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made
					them available to You on our Service. You agree that the original
					English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.
				</small>
				<h4 className='my-4'>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h4>
				<small>
					We reserve the right, at Our sole discretion, to modify or replace
					these Terms at any time. If a revision is material We will make
					reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any
					new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be
					determined at Our sole discretion.
				</small>
				<small>
					By continuing to access or use Our Service after those revisions
					become effective, You agree to be bound by the revised terms. If You
					do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please stop using
					the website and the Service.
				</small>
				<h4 className='my-4'>Orders procedure</h4>
				<small>
					After the user has contacted us with their service requirements, they
					must create an account and update/her billing details in the profile
					section of the dashboard—post which our team members will create an
					order. A payment link for the created order will be visible on the
					user dashboard. Once the user completes the payment transaction, the
					engagement for the order will begin. The user will receive a payment
					confirmation email, and the invoice will be available for viewing on
					the dashboard section on the date mentioned by the team member.
				</small>
				<h3 className='my-4'>Refund Policy</h3>
				<small>
					When a payment of fee is made to Ilamurugu &amp; Associates, the fees
					paid is retained by us. During an engagement, Ilamurugu &amp;
					Associates earns a fee at different rates and different stages
					depending on the completion of various milestones ( obtaining DIN,
					Filing of forms, etc.,). Refund of full amount may not be possible
					since resources and man hours spent on delivering the service are
					non-returnable in nature. Further, refunds cannot be processed for any
					credit/money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or
					taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order.
					Under any circumstance, Ilamurugu &amp; Associates shall be liable to
					refund only upto the fee paid by the client.
				</small>

				<h4 className='my-4'>Procedure for Requesting Refund</h4>
				<small>
					After signing in, refund requests can be initiated from the user
					dashboard under the orders section. We do not accept Refund requests
					placed 30 days after the order commencement. We will complete
					processing your refund request within 10 business days after receiving
					all the information required for processing the refund, like the
					reason for the refund and bank details for processing the request. It
					may take up to 5-7 business days for the refund to reflect in your
					account after successfully processing your request for the same. If
					you are not eligible for a refund request, the option for the same
					will be automatically disabled on your dashboard. In an exceptional
					case, if you think there has been a mistake, you can contact us, and
					we will be happy to resolve your issue.
				</small>
				<h4 className='my-4'>Cancellation Fee</h4>
				<small>
					Given that we're incurring expenses and dedicating time, workforce,
					innovation resources, and effort to your service or record
					preparation, our assurance only covers complete satisfaction concerns
					caused by us and not adjustments to your scenario or state of mind. If
					you call for us to hold the service processing, we will certainly hold
					the charge paid on your account until you can resume your service.
					Before processing any refund, we book the right to make the best
					effort to complete the solution. If you are not satisfied with the
					service, a termination cost of 10% + government fees would be
					applicable. In the case of service modification, the termination
					charge would certainly not be applicable.
				</small>
